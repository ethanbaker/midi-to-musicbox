Convert Midi tracks to music box sheets!

---

## About

This project is designed to convert a Midi track into a music box sheet. The
Midi file gets sent through a parser, coded completely in Go, so each note for
every track in the file is recorded. Then, the parsed data can be converted to
an image that represents the music box sheet with various parameters, such as
height, width, notes, and others.

There are future plans to create a web GUI and local web server for easy setup.
